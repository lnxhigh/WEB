		<h2>Slither.io</h1>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p><strong>Slither.io</strong>[a] is a multiplayer online video game available for iOS, Android, and web browsers, developed by Steve Howse. Players control an avatar resembling a snake, which consumes multi-colored pellets, both from other players and ones that naturally spawn on the map in the game, to grow in size. The objective of the game is to grow the longest snake in the server. Slither.io is similar in concept to the popular 2015 web game Agar.io and is reminiscent of the classic arcade game Snake.</p>

		<p>The game grew in popularity following its promotion among several prominent YouTube users such as PewDiePie, and topped the App Store soon after its release. Slither.io's browser version was ranked by Alexa as one of the 1,000 most visited sites by July 2016, while the iOS version ranked first in the most downloaded apps on the App Store. A mobile version of the game for Android was released on March 27, 2016. The reception of the game was positive, with reviewers praising its appearance and customization but criticizing it for its low replay value and the high price users must pay to remove advertisements.</p>

		<h3>Gameplay</h3>
		<p>In Diep.io, the main objective for the player is to earn points by destroying different polygon objects and killing other players by firing bullets with their tank. By earning points, the tank levels up. Leveling up allows the player to invest a skill point into tank characteristics such as movement speed and bullet damage, allowing players to get an advantage over other players.</p> 
		<p>Players can also upgrade their tank to more powerful classes every 15 levels up until level 45, giving them abilities other tanks may not have.[4][5][6] Diep.io features various maps for different game modes, featuring team mechanics such as Free-For-All, Domination, and Tag.[5][4]</p>
