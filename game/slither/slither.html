				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p><strong>Slither.io</strong> is a multiplayer online video game available for iOS, Android, and web browsers, developed by Steve Howse. Players control an avatar resembling a snake, which consumes multi-colored pellets, both from other players and ones that naturally spawn on the map in the game, to grow in size. The objective of the game is to grow the longest snake in the server. Slither.io is similar in concept to the popular 2015 web game Agar.io and is reminiscent of the classic arcade game Snake.</p>

				<p>The game grew in popularity following its promotion among several prominent YouTube users such as PewDiePie, and topped the App Store soon after its release. Slither.io's browser version was ranked by Alexa as one of the 1,000 most visited sites by July 2016, while the iOS version ranked first in the most downloaded apps on the App Store. A mobile version of the game for Android was released on March 27, 2016. The reception of the game was positive, with reviewers praising its appearance and customization but criticizing it for its low replay value and the high price users must pay to remove advertisements.</p>

				<h3>Gameplay</h3>
				<p>The objective of the game is to control a snake, also known as "slithers", around a wide area and eat pellets, defeating and consuming other players to gain mass to grow the largest and longest in the game. Once players are spawned into the virtual world, their avatar remains in constant motion. If the player's snake's head collides another slither, the player will die. The defeated avatar's body turns into bright, larger shining pellets for other players to consume. These pellets that remain from "death" of an avatar will correspond to the color of the avatar itself, and are both brighter and bigger than "normal" pellets, which spawn naturally throughout the world. Normal pellets do not give as much mass as pellets dropped from other snakes. "Chase" pellets will appear individually in various places of the world; when eaten, they give a greater amount of mass than pellets dropped by other snakes. Chase pellets avoid snakes and flee when they draw near. Chase pellets can be obtained by boosting.</p>
